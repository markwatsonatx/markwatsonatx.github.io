![Super Unofficial](/img/profile0.jpg){: .post-content-profile } In the upcoming days and weeks
I will be creating tutorials for a number of technologies (starting with RethinkDB). My goal is
to create many concise video tutorials that help you learn a technology in small steps.

I will be using Docker and Docker Compose
to make it super easy to download, run, and experiment with each tutorial. This will allow you 
to run apps and services such as Node.js, RethinkDB, and Apache Spark in isolated containers.

This video shows you how it works:
