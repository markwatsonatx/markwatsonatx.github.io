![Super Official](/img/profile1.jpg){: .post-content-profile } Check out this video to see all the great features that
are new and coming to IBM Cloudant. I give a demo of the Location Tracker app, an iOS app developed in Swift that
tracks your location, uses [Cloudant Sync for iOS](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore) to sync locations
to Cloudant and [Cloudant Geo](https://docs.cloudant.com/geo.html) to find points of interest around your location.
The demo is at the 37 minute mark.
